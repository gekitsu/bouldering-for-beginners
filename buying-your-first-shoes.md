## Feet and How They Relate to Climbing Shoes

Since a good fit is about matching shoes to feet, knowing about the shape of your feet is an important factor.
If you have been able to choose shoes on your shoe size alone so far, you should definitely consider thinking of your feet in terms of their width, volume, and overall shape, instead of just their length.

### Shoe Size

Shoe size is probably the factor of shoe fit you’re most familiar with.
It measures your foot’s length from the rearmost part of the heel to the most forward point of your toes.
Across the world, several different measuring systems for shoe size are in use, such as the Paris point system in Europe and barleycorn-based systems in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Shoe size is a very obvious and necessary factor in fitting shoes, but for climbing shoes, merely finding the correct shoe length is not sufficient.
If, for example, a shoe is too wide or narrow, no amount of finding the right size will make it fit well.

Furthermore, Shoe size is not a measure you determine once and you’re good.
In non-climbing shoes, manufacturers can use shoe size to describe the average foot length for which a shoe is deemed suitable, the length of the shoe’s inside cavity, or the length of the last the shoe was built on.
Depending on which sizing system a manufacturer is building shoes in ‘natively,’ size conversions to other systems may also be off by small degrees.

In climbing shoes specifically, how your street shoe size relates to climbing shoe size varies *greatly* between brands.
Knowing that you got a great fit in one manufacturer’s EU size 40, another manufacturer’s shoes might fit you well 3 EU sizes (~2 UK/US sizes) off from that.
For building up your experience of fitting climbing shoes, you’ll do well thinking of shoe size in terms of which *size* of what *brand* gave you what *sort of fit*.

But in general, it almost always pays off to try on several sizes of a given model to really find the one that is best for you.

### Width

In addition to their length, feet can also be described by their width.
Commonly, this refers to the maximum width a foot reaches, across the forefoot, but whether you have wide or narrow heels is also a consideration.

Unlike shoe size, width is rarely described with a measuring system.
(Although such systems exist!
You can look up the Mondopoint system and the Brannock Device on Wikipedia for further information.)
Rather, shoes are said to fit more on the wide or the narrow side, and you have to see for yourself whether they are any good for you.

This is a crucial difference to shoe size:
While you can have the same model of shoe in multiple sizes and see which one is the correct length for your feet, shoe models don’t usually come in different widths for you to try out.
A given model might accomodate a spectrum of forefoot or heel widths, but if your foot still has sideways wiggle room in a correctly chosen size, that model does not fit your feet and you will have to find another one.

### Volume

We all know shoe size from buying sneakers and foot width is as straightforward and descriptive as it gets, but volume is neither an intuitive measurement nor something one has necessarily encountered before.

Volume describes, in simple terms, the *height* of your foot.
Think the difference between your foot’s instep making a steeper or flatter incline.
You could also think of volume as the difference that makes a foot of a certain length and width take up more or less space.

To make matters worse, while shoe size has established measuring systems and width has rarely-used ones, there is no measurement scale for foot volume.
The only guideline I have been able to find was advice from a ski boot fitter:
If you take a tape measure from the inside rear of your heel over your instep and around to the outside rear of your heel, a length of around your foot length (plus/minus 1 cm or 1/2″) is a medium foot volume.
A length larger or shorter than that indicates a high or volume foot.

But all these are mere guidelines, not definite measurements.
It is more important to be aware that feet differ in volume and being too high or too low volume is a way a shoe can not fit your foot well.
If the shoe model you are trying on comes in a high volume and low volume version, you can use that choice to dial fit.
If it does not and volume is off by too much, that shoe does not fit your feet.

Note that height of the foot at the instep – the top of your foot – is not the same thing as the height of your sole’s arch.
You can have pronounced arches and your feet are still low volume just as well as flat feet can be high volume.

### Toe Profile

The proportions of your toes can influence shoe fit, but this is not a cut and dry affair.

Generally speaking, there is no agreed-upon list of ‘foot types’ and their names.
What this is all about is the relative lengths of your toes.
In some people, the big toe is the longest and each neighboring toe is successively shorter, while others have a longer second toe, or not that much length difference between their toes at all.

While it is somewhat obvious that when we want to fit shoes with toes touching the front, the shape your toes make has something to do with the shape the shoe should have, don’t be too prescriptive about this!
For example, it is possible to have a longer second toe, but it has so much range of motion that it comfortably makes your feet fit into a very pointy toe box with the point at your big toe.

If in doubt, always try shoes on and see how they feel.
But it is useful to keep in mind that mismatching toes and toe box can leave empty space in front of some toes or push too painfully against others.
Both of these should be avoided, especially the latter.

## Anatomy of a Climbing Shoe

* shoes are built on a last, a sort of foot dummy akin to a sewing body form/mannequin
* the shape of this last influences the fit and design of the shoe, as well as the choices of parts

### Parts

This chapter is about the parts that go into making a shoe.
It is useful knowledge to have for being able to decipher reviews of climbing shoes and for speaking more precisely about them.

#### Upper

The shoe’s body itself is called the upper.
This is the parts of material sewn together to cover the last like a sock.
By itself, it is fairly floppy, but it’s the part of the shoe in contact with your feet and that the different bits of rubber, elastic, and closure system are attached to.

Uppers come in different materials.
Leather is the old school choice, rugged and fairly breathable.
When unlined, it can stretch a good bit over the course of being broken in.
That gives you a very custom fit, but needs to be accounted for when buying the shoes.
Areas covered by rubber or otherwise constrained will stretch much less, as will lined leather.
They will also breathe less.

The other big group of materials is synthetics.
Most of these are microfibre-based, such as Lorica, Alcantara, and too many more or less brand-name choices to list them all.
They generally tend to breathe less well, which makes shoes smelly much easier than leather.
On the other hand, synthetic materials are more form-stable and don’t stretch much.

#### Midsole

The midsole is a piece of plastic that is glued between the upper’s sole part and the outsole to add further resistance against flexing.
This property of a shoe is called support or stiffness and we’ll treat it separately in the *Properties* section of this chapter.

Sadly, midsoles aren’t often advertised or described directly in manufacturer’s copy and aren’t easily accessible to reviewers either (without disassembling a shoe, that is), but their shape and material can make a lot of difference in how a shoe behaves.
They come in all sorts of shapes from minimal slivers of thin plastic to full-length boards of substantial material.
Some may even employ fancier materials like molded plastics made to follow a curve on its own instead of just being a flat sheet.

#### Outsole

The outsole is the rubber piece you use to step on footholds with.
It’s what you’d usually merely call ‘the sole’ if you didn’t need to make a difference between midsoles and outsoles.
Naturally, it being where (almost literally) rubber meets road, it is a very important part of the shoe.

Climbing shoe outsoles don’t come in all sorts of tread designs – they’re all flat rubber sheeting – but they still come in different designs that excel at different things.
A full length outsole covers the entire length of the shoe from toe to heel.
A split outsole, on the other hand, has a separate sole sheet under the front of the foot, with the heel being its own part.
This makes a difference in stiffness in the midfoot.

The thickness of the rubber used is another factor in outsole design.
Climbing inevitably wears the outsole away bit by bit.
A solid 5 mm sheet of rubber will provide more stiffness and make it a bit harder to feel every nuance under your feet, and also be way more durable.
If the rubber sheet material is a more 3 mm thick, it will enable you to feel much more through it, contribute less stiffness, and wear away much faster.

Finally, not all climbing shoe soles are made of the same rubber compound.
They are all what was at the time of its invention called ‘sticky rubber’ but different compounds offer different balances of properties.
Generally, the harder a rubber compound is, the more it resists deforming.
This becomes important on tiny footholds where a weighted tip of the shoe would deform a softer rubber’s edge enough to make it pop off the foothold.
Harder rubbers are also usually more durable, but they don’t offer as much pure friction.

Maximum friction is the strength of softer rubber compounds.
It comes at the cost of durability and how well it performs on tiny edges.

Finally, rubber compounds may also be optimised for durability at the cost of performance overall.
Think rental shoes and the mileage they have to survive while also not being overly expensive.

#### Closure System

Closure systems are what keeps the shoe tight against your foot and make it resist coming off, you know these from your street shoes.
In climbing shoes, they come with different advantages and disadvantages.

Laces are the old school method.
Most climbing shoe designs with laces have the lacing extend very far down the shoe, so you can get the exactly right amount of snugness at every part of the foot.
They not only allow for a very finely tuned fit, they also allow for cinching down a great deal around narrow or low volume parts of your foot.
Their biggest downside is that they take a long time to put on and take off.
For bouldering, where you might want to take your shoes off between attempts, this is a much bigger impediment than it is for something like climbing a big wall.
Another disadvantage is that the lacing reaching far down the shoe leaves less space down the toe for a big toehook patch.

Velcro is the sweet spot that does everything well enough.
Two or three straps of velcro allow for a reasonable amount of adaptability around the midfoot, leave some space on top of the forefoot for a toehook patch, and they go on and come off in seconds.
Of course, having no way to tighten down near to the toes means that the toebox needs to fit your foot well, and your midfoot shouldn’t be so much lower in volume that you get barely any overlap of hook and loop portion of the velcro strap.
But there is a reason velcro shoes are everywhere.

Slippers have no closure system per se, just elastic insets in the upper that pull the material close to your foot, like a stretchy sock.
They have enormous space on the forefoot, and are taken off even faster than velcro shoes.
However, they come with a much narrower spectum of foot shapes that fit them well enough – if your feet are just a bit too low volume, the elastic won’t provide enough to make the shoes stay on your feet.
And even on a very good fit, they aren’t as securely fixed to your foot as a laceup or velcro shoe.
Pulling on a heel hook might just be enough to rather pull the shoe off your foot than make you pull yourself up by the heel.

The slipper with a single velcro strap tries to alleviate the slipper’s worst shortcomings:
You still get that big space for toehook patches, but the velcro strap all the way up the shoe keeps it on your foot no matter how hard you crank on it.
The single strap might even be able to make up for a slightly too low volume upper midfoot, but the single-strap slipper still isn’t the design to accomodate a wider variety of foot shapes.

Another way of closing shoes works by way of one or more webbing straps zig-zagging down the shoe and either having velcro at the top end or on a pull tab sliding along the strap.
Every brand has their own way of implementing this sort of system, and they all have their own name for it.
But the gist is that a narrow strap of zig-zagging webbing can reach further down the foot than a wide strap of velcro, so you get some of the benefits of a laceup shoe with some of the velcro shoe’s ease.

#### Rand & Tensioning

The rand is a thinner strip of sheet rubber that runs at least around the forefoot of the shoe (but often also around the sides and the heel) to provide a structural frame to withstand the pressure of a snug fit.
Imagine if you put your foot into a plain, floppy upper with a sole glued underneath it – your toes would push the upper material out over the tip of the sole on even a mildly tight fit.
The forefoot area is also prone to abrasion, with the way we step with the very tip of the toe on small footholds and put the shoe’s tip right up against the wall.
A rand provides more abrasion resistance than the plain upper material would provide.

Many shoes have more rubber strips glued around them in varying patterns.
These are mostly to put some level of tension on the shoe to make it want to spring into a certain shape.
The most common of these is a rubber band around the upper heel/achilles area – this compresses the heel cup in a way that when you put your foot in, it wants to push your foot forward into the toebox.
But many more such systems are employed to make the shoe curl more into a downturned shape, pull into a shape that hugs your foot more, and so on.

#### Heel Cup

The heel cup is a sort of collective term for both the fit of the heel part of a shoe – how wide or narrow and how deep or shallow it is – and its design.
The classic way of building a heel on a climbing shoe is to let the sole rubber extend back up the heel so you can use the thicker outsole rubber for heel hooks.

Some shoes don’t have heels built up from strips of sheet rubber, but instead employ a heel cup made from a single piece of rubber molded into shape.
These molded heel cups are usually significantly more resistant to deforming.
Whether or not that is an advantage for you is a matter of taste.
A molded heel cup’s structural integrity can make it possible to use its edge as a very solid feature to hook behind a sharp foothold, and its thickness can enable you to pull very hard on a sharp foothold without having to fear even the slightest pain.
On the other hand, you might prefer a traditional heel cup’s higher sensitivity or that its squishiness can make it more accomodating to differently shaped heels.

#### Toehook Patch

Some shoes have a piece of soft rubber on top of the toes and forefoot, sometimes even reaching up to the midfoot, to give you more friction when employing a toehook.
A simpler or more minimal design can just have the rand be a little wider over the big toe area, while a more aggressive design might have a big separate patch of extra sticky rubber glued on top of the shoe.

One factor outside of how well a toehook patch makes a shoe perform on toehooks is that areas of the upper covered by rubber have less leeway of moving with the shape of your feet.
That can make the toebox of a shoe with a big toehook patch feel harder against your feet than a shoe that allows its soft upper material to bulge and squish a bit around a bent toe knuckle.

### Design Factors

This chapter is about aspects of shoe design.
Most of these factors will be determined by the shape of the last, like downturn and asymmetry.
All shoes built on that last will have that same basic shape.

Some factors, like stiffness, are entirely determined by choice of materials.
In these cases, it’s possible that a manufacturer builds a softer and a stiffer shoe on the same last, and if one of them fits you well, the other will probably do, too.

#### Downturn

Downturn is the name for how much the shoe is in a banana shape when seen from the side.
In other words, when the shoe’s tip of the sole and heel are resting on the ground, how far off the ground the midfoot is.
No downturn means a flat sole.

The purpose of downturn is mainly to change the angle of your toe to be more pointed downwards.
That makes it easier to not just step on smaller footholds in overhanging walls but to pull on them with your feet.
It can also be an advantage on very small footholds where even a little bit of sole flex past horizontal makes you slip off the foothold.

#### Asymmetry

Asymmetry is another factor you’ll most likely encounter when reading climbing.
Like downturn, it describes a ‘bend’ in the shoe, but this time it’s not about bending sideways instead of up and down.

In part, asymmetry describes the toebox shape, seen from above.
A less asymmetric shoe would have its frontmost point closer to the shoe’s centre line, while a more asymmetric shoe’s will be further off the centre line.

Asymmetry also describes the amount of sideways banana shape a shoe has – toe and heel inward, midfoot outward.
This shoe shape obviously can’t bend your foot to conform to it.
They just don’t move that way.
But when you put your feet into a sideways bent shoe and force it to conform to your feet, the shoe will push inwards against your toes and heels, from pinkie to big toe.
This extra force of shoe against feet will push your little toes into your big toe for a more compact fit in the toebox, as well as make the heel’s outside sit more snugly against your foot.

What is the tradeoff for all of this?
Comfort.

#### Stiffness

While downturn and asymmetry are determined by the shape of the shoe’s last, stiffness is entirely a question of materials.
Stiffness means how much a shoe’s sole withstands being flexed or deformed.
In turn, it means how much the shoe will support your foot on small footholds or stave off fatigue on sustained climbing.
Stiffness and support come at the detriment of softness and sensitivity, the ability of the shoe to conform to a hold shape, and of you to feel a hold through the sole.

While stiffness is the product of all the shoe’s materials’ abilities to withstand flexing, it is mainly determined by the midsole.
In addition, the outsole’s design and thickness will lend some structural integrity, as well as the parts of the shoe’s tensioning system responsible for pulling the sole into a shape.

I think it is insufficient to think of shoes as having a single degree of stiffness.
Midsoles come not only in a variety of material stiffnesses, they also come in a wide variety of shapes.
The same stiffness material could be cut into a midsole the length of the shoe, or just a narrow crescent underneath the pads of your toes.
So it’s not just about *how much* bending resistance a shoe provides, it’s also about *where* it provides that bending resistance (and where it doesn’t).
Because this makes a big difference to how the shoe behaves, let’s talk about this in some more detail:

A midsole that spans the entire sole of your foot (or close to it) will lend the most support.
Underneath your toe tips, it will provide resistance against the shoe’s front edge flexing up and pinging off the foothold.
Underneath the balls of your feet, it will provide resistance against your toes flexing up and making you skate off the foothold – the muscles of your feet will have to bear less of that load.
That makes full-length midsoles useful for climbers that don’t have a lot of strength in their feet (yet), and climbers whose climbing will exhaust the strength of their feet:
Big wall climbers who will be climbing several rope lengths in one go and trad climbers who will spend extra time standing on the wall to place protection instead of just clipping a quickdraw into a bolt.
Crack climbers’ foot jamming techniques will also often benefit from a shoe with high torsional stability along its entire sole.
A drawback of midsoles providing this much support is that you will have a harder time getting a big bend in the balls of your feet for when you want to place the maximum amount of rubber on a volume.

Midsoles that provide stiffness mainly in the forefoot will retain the shoe’s structural integrity at the tip of your toes on small holds, but make it much easier to bend at the balls of your feet.
That means it is easier for your feet to tire out on high mileage, but will give you much more technical versatility in exchange.
We believe that this sort of midsole is the most versatile overall, and the best choice for most climbers unless their discipline requires full-foot support.
For sport climbing and especially bouldering, highly sustained effort is rarely a factor, but the versatility to more easily stand on a shallow volume or smear on sheer rock will be a big benefit.

Finally, the most minimal midsoles will only provide stability across the very front of your shoe, just underneath of your toe tips.
This puts the highest demand on your feet, since you’ll now have to use strength for every aspect of keeping them stable while standing on small edges.
On the other hand, not only will you have a very easy time smearing, you’ll be able to feel nearly every ripple under your feet, have the outsole conform to it for maximum friction, and even use your toes to grab and pull on small surface ripples.

#### Toebox

The toebox is the front part of the shoe that houses – unsurprisingly – your toes.
Since we are stepping with the tips of our toes, it is a very important part of a good fit.

One factor of the toe box is which toe profile it fits well.
Different manufacturers give different amounts of guidance on this, but it’s worth keeping in mind that a very pointy shoe might not do well on feet that don’t have much length difference between the toes, and vice versa.
A good giveaway for this is when you can find a size that fits the pinkie toe side of your feet snugly, but is too tight or too loose on the big toe, and the size that makes your big toe fit either squishes your pinkie toes or gives them too much room.

Furthermore, when you look at the toebox from the side, you can determine that some are more flat while others give your toes a lot of vertical space.
The latter indicate a shoe that wants your toes curled up against the front of the toebox, while a flatter toebox accomodates a less pressurised fit.

#### Men’s & Women’s? What’s the Deal?

If you studied the product catalogues of many manufacturer’s, you’ve probably encountered ‘Men’s’ and ‘Women’s’ variants of the same shoe model.
Usually, these variant combine several of the shoe last and shoe design choices we mentioned so far.
Of course, every manufacturer treats this differently, but it’s a safe assumption that a Woman’s variant will be built on a somewhat narrower and lower volume last, and may be designed for lower bodyweight climbers, like a slightly softer midsole and maybe even with a stickier outsole rubber.
For mysterious reasons, the Men’s variants usually come in a strong primary colour scheme (yellow or red dominant) while Women’s variants get to sport secondary colours (mainly teal or purple).

Having two models of the same shoe for slightly different foot proportions sounds like a big benefit for climbers, right?
If the sales department insists on labeling them by gender, why should we care, when we can just buy the model that fits our feet?
In theory, yes.
In reality, there is one more constraint:
Where a given shoe’s Men’s variant is available in a reasonable array of sizes (let’s say EU 34–46.5, UK 2–11.5, USM 3–12.5, USW 4.5–14), the Women’s model can easily only be available in a reduced subset (something like EU 34–42, UK 2–8, USM 3–9, USW 4.5–10.5).
And all this for no real reason.

Fortunately, at the time of writing (early 2023), it is becoming increasingly more common for manufacturer’s to sell a high volume and a low volume (often labeled ‘HV’ and ‘LV’) across the full spectrum of sizes without any further assumptions.

#### Neutral, Moderate & Aggressive? What’s That About?

Another categorisation of climbing shoes you can find online is ‘neutral’, ‘moderate’/‘intermediate’, and ‘aggressive’.
These usually comprise downturn, heel tensioning, and potentially also asymmetry.
The implicit assumption is that they increase simultaneously from a flat, low-tension, low asymmetry shoe to a highly downturned, high-tension, high asymmetry shoe.

That is not an unreasonable shorthand (but keep in mind it *is* a simplification), as long as you don’t mix it up with the assumption that the progression from ‘neutral’ to ‘aggressive’ mirrors a progression from ‘beginner’ to ‘advanced’, or high performance shoe.

If you don’t keep in mind that this is a shorthand, you’ll have a hard time reasoning about shoes where the three factors don’t scale with each other, say a highly downturned, highly tensioned shoe with less asymmetry.

If you get it mixed up with a scale from beginner to high performance shoe, you are implying that every high performance shoe looks a certain way, when there exist shoes that defy this assumption.
We are seeing increasing amounts of shoe models aimed at comparatively beginner climbers that already introduce degrees of downturn.
There are also shoe models built to perform at the highest level, but on long multipitch climbs either standing on tiny granite crystals or jammed into flaring cracks, not overhanging boulder problems.

## How to choose Your First Shoe

### Demands Placed On a First Shoe

What is the role your first shoe is going to fill?
Which demands will it have to fulfill?
These are the leading questions that are going to inform a lot of decisions that are not decided by fit.

If you are going from rental shoes to your first own pair, you’ll probably want them to be a step up in quality.
That means better materials and higher build quality.
With rental shoes having to endure mileage and abuse at the expense of nearly everything else, this is going to be easy to fulfill.

As a climber early in their climbing career, you’ll probably want to learn and improve your technique as well.
For the shoe, that means not only enabling you to properly employ techniques and step with precision, but also surviving your climbing when your technique isn’t yet up to snuff and you’re leaving more rubber on the wall than you should.
A thicker outsole or a rubber compound favouring durability are beneficial for that.

Hence, many common beginners’ shoe models look somewhat similar:
They have no downturn, low asymmetry, low tensioning, a toebox accomodating toes laying flat instead of being all the way crimped up, stiff full-length midsoles and thick outsoles of lower-performance rubber.
And that’s not a bad design direction.
It makes the shoe less demanding to fit, supportive enough to not put a lot of strain on your feet, and it can leave a lot of thick rubber streaks on the wall without wearing through the sole.

However, that isn’t unavoidably the only way a shoe for a beginner has to look.
There is a long argument whether it is worth to buy a beginners’ shoe, only to buy a more bouldering-specific moderately aggressive shoe a short time later.
A counterpoint to that argument is that many shoes marketed at intermediate climbers don’t present a big enough step up in quality to justify how much closer to the uppermost price tier they are.

Be all that as it may, here is one line of argument some shoe manufacturers have been following:
Compared to climbing on rock, indoor climbing tends to have larger and more positive footholds.
And in the times of competitive climbing, indoor climbing has morphed into a quite distinct discipline from being a mere training grounds for the great outdoors.
Modern gym climbing features walking with aggressive smears on big volumes, and even the lower grades come with formerly high level techniques like toe- and heelhooks in steep overhangs.
Meanwhile, the classic neginners’ shoe outlined above is still modeled after the demands of the outdoor climbs a beginner might face – smaller footholds on vertical walls.
According to that logic, a beginner gym climber would get more use out of a softer shoe with a more ‘bouldery’ feature set, as long as it isn’t so aggressive that it demands a very cramped fit.

### What Does Fit Really Mean?

<!--* as mentioned earlier: snug but not painful is helpful, except when it’s not (to the beginner)-->
As mentioned earlier in this text, the commonly quoted description for good climbing shoe fit ‘snug, but not painful’ is pretty useful, except for when it’s not.
Because it takes some getting used to a fit that’s snug all around the foot, *every* shoe that’s this snug is going to be painful at first.

<!--* no wiggle room – the shoe and your foot don’t move against each other-->
Another way of describing the sort of fit we’re aiming for is that there is no wiggle room in the shoe.
There should be no way for the shoe and the foot to move against each other.
However, that is not a sufficient description because we’d also say that of a good fit for a hiking shoe.
And yet, the hiking shoe should cradle the foot firmly while providing excess room for your toes and forefoot to swell over the course of a hike, which is very much not what we want for a climbing shoe.

<!--* no dead space, especially in the toebox and heel (that means: even if they’re not crimped up against the toebox, the toes will have to touch it)-->
To be more precise, we want a fit that has no dead space between foot and shoe, or as little as possible, especially in the toebox and heel.
That means that even for a fit that does not have the toes crimped up against the toebox front, the toes will all make contact against the shoe.

<!--* no hot spots, where excessive pressure concentrates-->
While the shoes should exert a low level of pressure all around the feet, there should be no hot spots where they push extra hard.
(This demand for a precise match between foot and shoe shape is why there are chapters describing feet and shoes earlier.)
Of course, when your entire feet are in pain because you aren’t used to the sensation, it’s not easy to tell apart a spot that hurts more.

<!--* once acclimatised to the sensation, you can step on a foothold with your big toe and fully weight it-->
And finally, a good fit can’t be determined just by how the shoe is on your unweighted foot.
In a properly fitting shoe, you can step with your big toe on a foothold and weight it with your full bodyweight.

### The Process of Finding Your Shoe

With all this established, how best to go about finding a shoe?

<!--* try many models, even those you didn’t have on your radar-->
The first recommendation we have is to try on as many models as you can.
Even ones you didn’t have on your radar.
The more different shoes you’ve had on your feet, the larger the variety of sensations to base your choice on.

<!--* try many sizes, sit with each pair for a while to get past the initial reaction of ‘ow ow ow’ as best as possible-->
The second recommendation is to try many sizes of each model to tease out what you can and can not bear on your feet.
Sitting with the shoes on your feet for a while can help overcome the initial painful impression to a degree, and is definitely worth the time.

<!--* that makes brick and mortar stores better than online, even if they’re more expensive than online shopping-->
Both of these recommendations make well-stocked brick and mortar stores a better choice than shopping online, even if they are a little more expensive.
Finding good stores isn’t always easy, but word of mouth from other climbers or gym staff (if the gym isn’t selling shoes themselves) can be helpful.

<!--* if the store has a small section of climbing wall, test it on those after acclimatising-->
Most stores that sell climbing shoes provide either a short section of climbing wall or just a couple inconspicuously placed footholds for trying out shoes.
After the initial acclimatisation period to the shoe, try stepping on a foothold with your big toe and weighting it.
Expect this to feel more painful than just having the shoes on, but it should still be a bearable (if not really *fun*) sensation.

<!--* the big difficulty is to discern pain of not being used to this sensation (you will get used to it) and pain from trying to fit your feet into too small shoes (you will/should not get used to this)-->
The big difficulty in this process is to discern the pain of not being used to the sensation of wearing a snugly fitting shoe and the pain from having your feet in shoes that are too small.
You will get used to the former relatively quick, but you will (or should) not get used to the latter.
Having to make a decision that will hold up after you get used to having snugly fitted climbing shoes on your feet, while not yet being used to it, is what makes your first pair of shoes tricky.

<!--* almost every climber i know has a story of that one pair of too small shoes they bought – maybe try not to make these your first pair (anonymous quotes from discord members?)-->
Many climbers have a story about that one pair of shoes where they opted for a half size too small.
It’s definitely not an uncommon problem in one’s ongoing quest to find out what we can wear – but maybe try not to make your first pair the one where you went a step too far.

(anonymous discord member quotes go here)

<!--* knowledgeable and capable sales staff can be immensely helpful bridging your experience gap-->
A further advantage to a good brick and mortar store is that you can have a knowledgeable salesperson next to you.
Good staff isn’t ubiquitous, of course, and you’re more likely to find specialised knowledge in a dedicated climbing store than in a general outdoors store’s tiny climbing aisle.
This is where word of mouth comes in helpful again.
Sales staff with experience helping new climbers find shoes can be a very potent tool to bridge your experience gap, don’t underestimate it.
Just be wary of people recommending to size down, size down, size down, without any further differentiation.

### Dos And Don’ts

<!--* do: take. your. time.-->
**Do: Take your time.**
This is not an easy decision and as a beginner, you’re not in the optimal position to make it.
Time spent feeling things out is rarely wasted.

<!--* don’t: favour a model because somebody else is wearing it-->
**Don’t: Favour a model of shoe because somebody else is wearing it.**
Whether it’s the shoe everybody at your gym is wearing, or a trusted friend swears by, or the best climber of all time used to climb something really hard, don’t be tempted to buy into a model of shoe on account of somebody else.
When a shoe gets worn often, that obviously means something about the shoe’s quality.
But you aren’t just looking for a very good shoe, you are looking for a shoe that works very well for you – your feet and where you’re at in your climbing journey right now.
Those are not the same thing.

<!--* do: buy at the store where a staff member took their time helping you – don’t be that person-->
**Do: Buy at the store where the staff helped you find a shoe that fits.**
Yes, you’ll probably be able to find a better deal online, but the people at the store gave you helpful advice you couldn’t easily have gotten otherwise.
Please don’t be that person.

<!--* don’t: think that you ought to buy (or have no business buying) certain models of shoes because you’re a beginner – there are reasons for/against certain types of shoes, but fit is paramount.-->
**Don’t: Think that you have to buy certain models, or have no business buying others because you’re a beginner.**
There are reasons for and against certain types of shoes, but whether it fits is still the most important question.

<!--* don’t: think you have to get a certain level of toes-crammed-tight fit right away (or downsize the number of sizes ‘everybody knows’ you have to do in that brand) – you’re doing yourself a favour easing into this over the course of a few pairs of shoes-->
**Don’t: Think that you have to downsize a certain amount right away.**
Whether it’s about a belief that climbing shoes must hurt and ought to be as tight as possible, that toes have to be crammed all the way tight into the toebox, that you must downsize the amount of shoe sizes a certain athlete does, or the number of sizes ‘everybody knows’ you have to downsize with that brand, there are too many factors at play in that question for such one-size-fits-all (heh) solutions.
There are questions of foot proportion, of experience, of individual tolerance, of apt fit for the type of shoe, of apt fit for the sort of climbing you want to do with it, and so on, all affecting which shoe size is the best choice.
And as a beginner especially, you’re doing yourself a favour easing into how tight to fit your shoes over the course of a few pairs.
