# Buying Your First Pair of Climbing Shoes

## Introduction

* buying your own climbing shoes the first thing to do when you think you’d want to take up this hobby

## TL;DR: Fit Is the Most Important Thing

* fit is paramount
* fit is different for everybody, and the ‘not painful’ part of ‘snug but not painful’ will change over time
* fit is difficult to judge when you are new to this: competent staff can help

## Feet and How They Relate to Climbing Shoes

### Shoe Size

Shoe size is probably the factor of shoe fit you’re most familiar with.
It measures your foot’s length from the rearmost part of the heel to the most forward point of your toes.
Across the world, several different measuring systems for shoe size are in use, such as the Paris point system in Europe and barleycorn-based systems in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Shoe size is a very obvious and necessary factor in fitting shoes, but for climbing shoes, merely finding the correct shoe length is not sufficient.
If, for example, a shoe is too wide or narrow, no amount of finding the right size will make it fit well.

Furthermore, Shoe size is not a measure you determine once and you’re good.
In non-climbing shoes, manufacturers can use shoe size to describe the average foot length for which a shoe is deemed suitable, the length of the shoe’s inside cavity, or the length of the last the shoe was built on.
Depending on which sizing system a manufacturer is building shoes in ‘natively,’ size conversions to other systems may also be off by small degrees.

In climbing shoes specifically, how your street shoe size relates to climbing shoe size varies *greatly* between brands.
Knowing that you got a great fit in one manufacturer’s EU size 40, another manufacturer’s shoes might fit you well 3 EU sizes (~2 UK/US sizes) off from that.
For building up your experience of fitting climbing shoes, you’ll do well thinking of shoe size in terms of which *size* of what *brand* gave you what *sort of fit*.

But in general, it almost always pays off to try on several sizes of a given model to really find the one that is best for you.

### Width

* wide to narrow, forefoot and heel

### Volume

* think ‘foot height’ or ‘flatness’, sometimes mild crossover into width (as more width = more displacement)

### Toe Profile

* several common ones, every brand deals with this differently

### Men’s & Women’s? What’s the Deal?

* often a conglomerate of factors: women’s models generally a narrower, lower volume foot, AND ALSO softer or built for less body weight

## Anatomy of a Climbing Shoe

### Parts

* outer (materials)
* closure system
* midsole
* outsole
* rand
* optionals: toehook patch
* optionals: molded heel cup

### Design Factors

* downturn
* asymmetry
* support/stiffness/softness
* toebox (made to fit which toe profile, meant to fit with flatter vs more crimped toes)

## How to choose Your First Shoe

### Demands Placed On a First Shoe

* a step-up from rentals, better materials, higher quality
* learning and improving technique
* what makes a common beginners’ model? is this unavoidable?

### What Does Fit Really Mean?

* as mentioned earlier: snug but not painful is helpful, except when it’s not (to the beginner)
* no wiggle room – the shoe and your foot don’t move against each other
* no dead space, especially in the toebox and heel (that means: even if they’re not crimped up against the toebox, the toes will have to touch it)
* no hot spots, where excessive pressure concentrates
* once acclimatised to the sensation, you can step on a foothold with your big toe and fully weight it

### The Process of Finding Your Shoe

* try many models, even those you didn’t have on your radar
* try many sizes, sit with each pair for a while to get past the initial reaction of ‘ow ow ow’ as best as possible
* that makes brick and mortar stores better than online, even if they’re more expensive than online shopping
* if the store has a small section of climbing wall, test it on those after acclimatising
* the big difficulty is to discern pain of not being used to this sensation (you will get used to it) and pain from trying to fit your feet into too small shoes (you will/should not get used to this)
	* almost every climber i know has a story of that one pair of too small shoes they bought – maybe try not to make these your first pair (anonymous quotes from discord members?)
* knowledgeable and capable sales staff can be immensely helpful bridging your experience gap

### Dos And Don’ts

* do: take. your. time.
* don’t: favour a model because somebody else is wearing it
* do: buy at the store where a staff member took their time helping you – don’t be that person
* don’t: think that you ought to buy (or have no business buying) certain models of shoes because you’re a beginner – there are reasons for/against certain types of shoes, but fit is paramount.
* don’t: think you have to get a certain level of toes-crammed-tight fit right away (or downsize the number of sizes ‘everybody knows’ you have to do in that brand) – you’re doing yourself a favour easing into this over the course of a few pairs of shoes

## Down the Road

### Shoe Care Basics

* don’t keep the shoes in your bag, let them dry and air out
* clean feet are an advantage
* it’s easier to keep ahead of stink than to fix it when it happens
* many many factors in shoes becoming smelly, so hard to have a one-size-fits-all solution

### Resoling

* what is resoling
* why resole
* when to send your shoes off for a resole

### Cycling Through Multiple Pairs

* what’s the use? gets more life out of your shoes
* a possible consideration for your second shoe, given certain circumstances
