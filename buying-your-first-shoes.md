## Feet and How They Relate to Climbing Shoes

Since a good fit is about matching shoes to feet, knowing about the shape of your feet is an important factor.
If you have been able to choose shoes on your shoe size alone so far, you should definitely consider thinking of your feet in terms of their width, volume, and overall shape, instead of just their length.

### Shoe Size

Shoe size is probably the factor of shoe fit you’re most familiar with.
It measures your foot’s length from the rearmost part of the heel to the most forward point of your toes.
Across the world, several different measuring systems for shoe size are in use, such as the Paris point system in Europe and barleycorn-based systems in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Shoe size is a very obvious and necessary factor in fitting shoes, but for climbing shoes, merely finding the correct shoe length is not sufficient.
If, for example, a shoe is too wide or narrow, no amount of finding the right size will make it fit well.

Furthermore, Shoe size is not a measure you determine once and you’re good.
In non-climbing shoes, manufacturers can use shoe size to describe the average foot length for which a shoe is deemed suitable, the length of the shoe’s inside cavity, or the length of the last the shoe was built on.
Depending on which sizing system a manufacturer is building shoes in ‘natively,’ size conversions to other systems may also be off by small degrees.

In climbing shoes specifically, how your street shoe size relates to climbing shoe size varies *greatly* between brands.
Knowing that you got a great fit in one manufacturer’s EU size 40, another manufacturer’s shoes might fit you well 3 EU sizes (~2 UK/US sizes) off from that.
For building up your experience of fitting climbing shoes, you’ll do well thinking of shoe size in terms of which *size* of what *brand* gave you what *sort of fit*.

But in general, it almost always pays off to try on several sizes of a given model to really find the one that is best for you.

### Width

In addition to their length, feet can also be described by their width.
Commonly, this refers to the maximum width a foot reaches, across the forefoot, but whether you have wide or narrow heels is also a consideration.

Unlike shoe size, width is rarely described with a measuring system.
(Although such systems exist!
You can look up the Mondopoint system and the Brannock Device on Wikipedia for further information.)
Rather, shoes are said to fit more on the wide or the narrow side, and you have to see for yourself whether they are any good for you.

This is a crucial difference to shoe size:
While you can have the same model of shoe in multiple sizes and see which one is the correct length for your feet, shoe models don’t usually come in different widths for you to try out.
A given model might accomodate a spectrum of forefoot or heel widths, but if your foot still has sideways wiggle room in a correctly chosen size, that model does not fit your feet and you will have to find another one.

### Volume

We all know shoe size from buying sneakers and foot width is as straightforward and descriptive as it gets, but volume is neither an intuitive measurement nor something one has necessarily encountered before.

Volume describes, in simple terms, the *height* of your foot.
Think the difference between your foot’s instep making a steeper or flatter incline.
You could also think of volume as the difference that makes a foot of a certain length and width take up more or less space.

To make matters worse, while shoe size has established measuring systems and width has rarely-used ones, there is no measurement scale for foot volume.
The only guideline I have been able to find was advice from a ski boot fitter:
If you take a tape measure from the inside rear of your heel over your instep and around to the outside rear of your heel, a length of around your foot length (plus/minus 1 cm or 1/2″) is a medium foot volume.
A length larger or shorter than that indicates a high or volume foot.

But all these are mere guidelines, not definite measurements.
It is more important to be aware that feet differ in volume and being too high or too low volume is a way a shoe can not fit your foot well.
If the shoe model you are trying on comes in a high volume and low volume version, you can use that choice to dial fit.
If it does not and volume is off by too much, that shoe does not fit your feet.

Note that height of the foot at the instep – the top of your foot – is not the same thing as the height of your sole’s arch.
You can have pronounced arches and your feet are still low volume just as well as flat feet can be high volume.

### Toe Profile

The proportions of your toes can influence shoe fit, but this is not a cut and dry affair.

Generally speaking, there is no agreed-upon list of ‘foot types’ and their names.
What this is all about is the relative lengths of your toes.
In some people, the big toe is the longest and each neighboring toe is successively shorter, while others have a longer second toe, or not that much length difference between their toes at all.

While it is somewhat obvious that when we want to fit shoes with toes touching the front, the shape your toes make has something to do with the shape the shoe should have, don’t be too prescriptive about this!
For example, it is possible to have a longer second toe, but it has so much range of motion that it comfortably makes your feet fit into a very pointy toe box with the point at your big toe.

If in doubt, always try shoes on and see how they feel.
But it is useful to keep in mind that mismatching toes and toe box can leave empty space in front of some toes or push too painfully against others.
Both of these should be avoided, especially the latter.

## Anatomy of a Climbing Shoe

* shoes are built on a last, a sort of foot dummy akin to a sewing body form/mannequin
* the shape of this last influences the fit and design of the shoe, as well as the choices of parts

### Parts

* the parts that go into assembling a shoe on its last
* useful for more identifying parts, more precise talk, deciphering reviews

#### Upper

The shoe’s body itself is called the upper.
This is the parts of material sewn together to cover the last like a sock.
By itself, it is fairly floppy, but it’s the part of the shoe in contact with your feet and that the different bits of rubber, elastic, and closure system are attached to.

Uppers come in different materials.
Leather is the old school choice, rugged and fairly breathable.
When unlined, it can stretch a good bit over the course of being broken in.
That gives you a very custom fit, but needs to be accounted for when buying the shoes.
Areas covered by rubber or otherwise constrained will stretch much less, as will lined leather.
They will also breathe less.

The other big group of materials is synthetics.
Most of these are microfibre-based, such as Lorica, Alcantara, and too many more or less brand-name choices to list them all.
They generally tend to breathe less well, which makes shoes smelly much easier than leather.
On the other hand, synthetic materials are more form-stable and don’t stretch much.

#### Midsole

The midsole is a piece of plastic that is glued between the upper’s sole part and the outsole to add further resistance against flexing.
This property of a shoe is called support or stiffness and we’ll treat it separately in the *Properties* section of this chapter.

Sadly, midsoles aren’t often advertised or described directly in manufacturer’s copy and aren’t easily accessible to reviewers either (without disassembling a shoe, that is), but their shape and material can make a lot of difference in how a shoe behaves.
They come in all sorts of shapes from minimal slivers of thin plastic to full-length boards of substantial material.
Some may even employ fancier materials like molded plastics made to follow a curve on its own instead of just being a flat sheet.

#### Outsole

The outsole is the rubber piece you use to step on footholds with.
It’s what you’d usually merely call ‘the sole’ if you didn’t need to make a difference between midsoles and outsoles.
Naturally, it being where (almost literally) rubber meets road, it is a very important part of the shoe.

Climbing shoe outsoles don’t come in all sorts of tread designs – they’re all flat rubber sheeting – but they still come in different designs that excel at different things.
A full length outsole covers the entire length of the shoe from toe to heel.
A split outsole, on the other hand, has a separate sole sheet under the front of the foot, with the heel being its own part.
This makes a difference in stiffness in the midfoot.

The thickness of the rubber used is another factor in outsole design.
Climbing inevitably wears the outsole away bit by bit.
A solid 5 mm sheet of rubber will provide more stiffness and make it a bit harder to feel every nuance under your feet, and also be way more durable.
If the rubber sheet material is a more 3 mm thick, it will enable you to feel much more through it, contribute less stiffness, and wear away much faster.

Finally, not all climbing shoe soles are made of the same rubber compound.
They are all what was at the time of its invention called ‘sticky rubber’ but different compounds offer different balances of properties.
Generally, the harder a rubber compound is, the more it resists deforming.
This becomes important on tiny footholds where a weighted tip of the shoe would deform a softer rubber’s edge enough to make it pop off the foothold.
Harder rubbers are also usually more durable, but they don’t offer as much pure friction.

Maximum friction is the strength of softer rubber compounds.
It comes at the cost of durability and how well it performs on tiny edges.

Finally, rubber compounds may also be optimised for durability at the cost of performance overall.
Think rental shoes and the mileage they have to survive while also not being overly expensive.

#### Closure System

Closure systems are what keeps the shoe tight against your foot and make it resist coming off, you know these from your street shoes.
In climbing shoes, they come with different advantages and disadvantages.

Laces are the old school method.
Most climbing shoe designs with laces have the lacing extend very far down the shoe, so you can get the exactly right amount of snugness at every part of the foot.
They not only allow for a very finely tuned fit, they also allow for cinching down a great deal around narrow or low volume parts of your foot.
Their biggest downside is that they take a long time to put on and take off.
For bouldering, where you might want to take your shoes off between attempts, this is a much bigger impediment than it is for something like climbing a big wall.
Another disadvantage is that the lacing reaching far down the shoe leaves less space down the toe for a big toehook patch.

Velcro is the sweet spot that does everything well enough.
Two or three straps of velcro allow for a reasonable amount of adaptability around the midfoot, leave some space on top of the forefoot for a toehook patch, and they go on and come off in seconds.
Of course, having no way to tighten down near to the toes means that the toebox needs to fit your foot well, and your midfoot shouldn’t be so much lower in volume that you get barely any overlap of hook and loop portion of the velcro strap.
But there is a reason velcro shoes are everywhere.

Slippers have no closure system per se, just elastic insets in the upper that pull the material close to your foot, like a stretchy sock.
They have enormous space on the forefoot, and are taken off even faster than velcro shoes.
However, they come with a much narrower spectum of foot shapes that fit them well enough – if your feet are just a bit too low volume, the elastic won’t provide enough to make the shoes stay on your feet.
And even on a very good fit, they aren’t as securely fixed to your foot as a laceup or velcro shoe.
Pulling on a heel hook might just be enough to rather pull the shoe off your foot than make you pull yourself up by the heel.

The slipper with a single velcro strap tries to alleviate the slipper’s worst shortcomings:
You still get that big space for toehook patches, but the velcro strap all the way up the shoe keeps it on your foot no matter how hard you crank on it.
The single strap might even be able to make up for a slightly too low volume upper midfoot, but the single-strap slipper still isn’t the design to accomodate a wider variety of foot shapes.

Another way of closing shoes works by way of one or more webbing straps zig-zagging down the shoe and either having velcro at the top end or on a pull tab sliding along the strap.
Every brand has their own way of implementing this sort of system, and they all have their own name for it.
But the gist is that a narrow strap of zig-zagging webbing can reach further down the foot than a wide strap of velcro, so you get some of the benefits of a laceup shoe with some of the velcro shoe’s ease.

* stiffness of the midsole material
* stiffness where in the foot, due to midsole shape

#### Toebox

#### Men’s & Women’s? What’s the Deal?

* often a conglomerate of factors: women’s models generally a narrower, lower volume foot, AND ALSO softer or built for less body weight
* AND ALSO usually only available in smaller sizes
* fortunately, at the time of writing, the trend goes strongly towards ungendered high/low volume models instead

## How to choose Your First Shoe

### Demands Placed On a First Shoe

* a step-up from rentals, better materials, higher quality
* learning and improving technique
* what makes a common beginners’ model? is this unavoidable?

### What Does Fit Really Mean?

* as mentioned earlier: snug but not painful is helpful, except when it’s not (to the beginner)
* no wiggle room – the shoe and your foot don’t move against each other
* no dead space, especially in the toebox and heel (that means: even if they’re not crimped up against the toebox, the toes will have to touch it)
* no hot spots, where excessive pressure concentrates
* once acclimatised to the sensation, you can step on a foothold with your big toe and fully weight it

### The Process of Finding Your Shoe

* try many models, even those you didn’t have on your radar
* try many sizes, sit with each pair for a while to get past the initial reaction of ‘ow ow ow’ as best as possible
* that makes brick and mortar stores better than online, even if they’re more expensive than online shopping
* if the store has a small section of climbing wall, test it on those after acclimatising
* the big difficulty is to discern pain of not being used to this sensation (you will get used to it) and pain from trying to fit your feet into too small shoes (you will/should not get used to this)
	* almost every climber i know has a story of that one pair of too small shoes they bought – maybe try not to make these your first pair (anonymous quotes from discord members?)
* knowledgeable and capable sales staff can be immensely helpful bridging your experience gap

### Dos And Don’ts

* do: take. your. time.
* don’t: favour a model because somebody else is wearing it
* do: buy at the store where a staff member took their time helping you – don’t be that person
* don’t: think that you ought to buy (or have no business buying) certain models of shoes because you’re a beginner – there are reasons for/against certain types of shoes, but fit is paramount.
* don’t: think you have to get a certain level of toes-crammed-tight fit right away (or downsize the number of sizes ‘everybody knows’ you have to do in that brand) – you’re doing yourself a favour easing into this over the course of a few pairs of shoes

## Down the Road

### Shoe Care Basics

* don’t keep the shoes in your bag, let them dry and air out
* clean feet are an advantage
* it’s easier to keep ahead of stink than to fix it when it happens
* many many factors in shoes becoming smelly, so hard to have a one-size-fits-all solution

### Resoling

* what is resoling
* why resole
* when to send your shoes off for a resole

### Cycling Through Multiple Pairs

* what’s the use? gets more life out of your shoes
* a possible consideration for your second shoe, given certain circumstances
