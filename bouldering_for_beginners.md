# Bouldering Tutorials for Beginners

Bouldering is amazing! And now that gyms are popping up everywhere, it is something that a lot more people can just walk up to and try, without having to worry about having this and that gear, access to an outdoor crag, or just the intimidation factor of *real rock*.

However, even though it is easy to visit the closest gym, rent a pair of shoes, and throw yourself on the wall, there is still a lot of smaller and bigger things that you don’t automatically know.
And they can impede how much progress you’re making, or whether or not you keep getting shut down on things that would be well within your reach.
Youtube to the rescue!

## General Beginners’ Tips

The most general kind of tutorial video.
You will not be getting anything comprehensive out of these, but in the very very beginning, too much information can be overwhelming.
These make a very good base for just starting out.

**Movement for Climbers – Bouldering Progression Series. Novice**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJNAC9zi8gg)\
A very well put together bundle of things for the start of your bouldering journey.
It’s compact enough that you can keep it all in mind, yet a solid toolkit for easy climbs.

**Bouldering Bobat – Top 10 Tips for Beginner Boulderers**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2v4brHpdxY)\
What it says on the tin.
A solid allround arsenal of pointers for when you’re starting out.

**Jenn Sends – 5 Tips for Starting Out**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si62hwththk)\
Mostly mindset, some essential gear, and small hacks to ease your first steps.

**Jenn Sends – Top 10 Beginner Mistakes When Bouldering**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6amIETSr-U)\
Mainly technique & etiquette.
A good list to check yourself against after getting into a bouldering routine.

## General Technique Videos

These go a bit more in-depth on different aspects of climbing technique, but still stay more or less in the realm of the general, not the specific.
Think of these as the daily bread and butter of how to get up walls.

### Footwork Tutorials

**Magnus Midtbø – Basic Foot Technique**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhcDSzw-MOk)\
I feel Magnus’ footwork tutorial is among the best on the subject.
It is terse and concise, but gives you a lot of technique pointers to immediately apply to your climbing, even for techniques beyond the need of a raw beginner, like heel- and toehooks, bicycles, etc.

**Bouldering Bobat – Foot Placement 101**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5L3NS5v_hU)\
Many of the more beginner-relevant issues Magnus covers, but less terse and a bit more conversational.

**Mani the Monkey – How to Improve Your Footwork**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9iPKm9HnKQ)\
Another take on the very basics of footwork.
Mani also mentions an aspect nobody else picked up on: The ability to pull on some footholds.

**Lattice Training – Rock Climbing Footwork Technique: Beginner Level & Basics**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoTG-0_smTE)\
One more take on the basics of stepping with the toe, smearing, and heel hooking, this time by Lattice Training’s Tom Randall.

**Geek Climber – 3 Footwork Tips for Beginners**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmbhr5i1HHw)\
Some very actionable pointers for when you incorporated ‘don’t step with the middle of your foot’ into your climbing.
His points on when to use the inside and outside edges are good goundwork for considering body positioning and some of the techniques outlined in Neil Gresham’s Masterclass linked below.

**Movement for Climbers – Climbing Tips for Short People – Episode 1: High Feet**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaDV3BefQg)\
This one is a bit more specific than the other videos, focussing on the intricacies of placing your feet relatively high.
Especially useful for short people, but not something tall folks should slouch too much on.

### Hands and Holds Tutorials

**Eric Karlsson Bouldering – Hand Placement**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G634356Sti0)\
Good very general technique pointers.

**Bouldering Bobat – Holds 101**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nREPcYSZeYQ)\
A run-down of indoor climbing hold types and how to deal with them.

**Mani the Monkey – Directional Loading and Hold Quality**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6pF4p3rqUI)\
This video segues partly into body positioning territory and has some info on footholds as well.
I still put it here because I feel it functionally ties together what you learned about gripping techniques and hold types in the other tutorials.

**Movement for Climbers – Body Positioning for Sidepulls & Underclings**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efaca9KZj8A)\
Similar to Mani’s video on directional loading, this video is about the combination of handhold and body position.
Very much worth a watch if holds that aren’t facing straight up are giving you trouble.

### Hips/Body Positioning Tutorials

**Eric Karlsson Bouldering – Hips**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbj7XMLOWgE)\
A very approachable but basic introduction to thinking about the position and movement of your hips in climbing.

**Movement for Climbers – First Rule of Climbing**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvOtFyY0fWI)\
An excellent tutorial walking you through a simple concept of how to use your hands and feet to position your body for maximum stability and efficiency.

**Bouldering Bobat – Body Position 101**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAo_ismiUEU)\
A good next step after the EKB video got you started thinking about your hips.
More about stability, efficient movement, etc.

**Mani the Monkey – Body Positioning and Centre of Gravity**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2FQiK2PbWo)\
Mani, as usual, goes full analytical on where to move your hips and why.
Also, there is one of the most useful tips to improve your overhang climbing in there!

**Bouldering Dabrats – Placing Your Hips on the Wall**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSejfiuIyDc)\
The headlights-on-your-hips visualisation is striking, and I like the explicitness of rocking over with hips square to the wall as a useful technique for vertical walls or slabs, and hip twists really coming into themselves on overhangs.

**rockentry - How to Improve Your Crimps With Body Positioning**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KbF3t5AyPA)\
The contrasting footage of the same problem with good and less good body positioning really drives home how much body positioning influences how easy or hard you make a set of moves for yourself.

## Specific Technique Tutorials

These videos go more in-depth on specific techniques or maneuvers, so they are good for expanding your vocabulary of movement or helping you improve specific problems.

### The One-Stop Shop: Neil Gresham’s Climbing Masterclass 1

[Youtube Playlist: Climbing Masterclass 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCRwO0FN0zMTqSfFW9SMbK2tncTrI25r)

This is a collection of basic techniques, each in its own short clip, so it’s easy to grasp each concept in isolation, and later revisit and freshen up on.
You can tell from the video quality and design that it used to be a commercial tape/dvd, but it’s now offered online for free.
As a beginner, you won’t really need the training part for a long while, but the techniques will all come in handy.

There also is a Climbing Masterclass 2 on skills & tactics on the same channel, which is more focused on how to approach difficult (outdoor) sport and trad climbing.

### Overhangs

Overhangs can seem daunting at first, and there are countless ways you can make life hard for yourself on them.
But they are a ton of fun to tackle, and technique makes all the difference.

**Jenn Sends – Going From Bad to OK at Overhangs**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL_ofrw2Zgw)\
Jenn gives you the cliff notes on Mani the Monkey’s overhangs tutorial plus video of her skill progression over a couple of weeks.

**Mani the Monkey – How to Climb Overhangs**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPrdTd7tMdc)\
The video Jenn summarised.
As per usual for Mani, more detail, even though I’d consider this one of his broader, less focused videos.
If you need more details about the techniques outlined, either revisit Gresham’s Masterclass or watch Mani’s climbing technique videos on all the individual techniques.
[Youtube playlist: Mani’s climbing technique videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfngg_GZtb93FAaysIMnmpfd3u6QlYDE)

**Movement for Climbers – Vertical vs Overhang – How to Climb on Different Terrain**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mabvTT6Bm0s)\
Another well explained look at how climbing technique for vertical and overhanging terrain differs.
Learn overhangs while gaining free vertical wall knowledge!

### Dynamic Movement and Dynos

Personally, I am a bit reluctant to include dynos (jumpy moves) in a beginners’ selection of tutorials, but if we’re being honest, they are part of the indoor climbing landscape, and not just at the high end of the grades either.

**Andrew MacFarlane – Learn Dynamic Climbing with Louis Parkinson**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY8Cycunx2A)\
Louis is not only a tremendously strong boulderer, he also has a knack for coming up with accessible training games to improve aspects of your climbing.

**Bouldering Bobat – Dynos 101**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q6hV7IXfM0)\
Jake is the Bobats’ dyno master, and he shows a nice progression to go from moving both hands at the same time to full-blown double dynos step by step.

### Slopers

Slopers are those bigger, often rounded handholds that don’t provide a clear edge you’re supposed to grab.
When you’re stuck not knowing where and how to grab them except putting your hand on top and finding it impossible to keep it from sliding off, and what other factors go into making them much more holdable, they can be a stumbling block in your climbing for sure.
Especially because people who know how to climb well on them will make it look too effortless to pick up what’s going on.
The concepts in the tutorials on body positioning and hold direction also are worth revisiting to improve your sloper game.

**Emil Abrahamsson – 7 Lessons to Help You Improve on Slopers**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rymuacrKR70)\
Emil gives a list of pointers that address the technical aspects of just strictly hanging off a slopy hold and more general technique pointers on how to deal with slopers in the context of a bouldering problem, as well as some training advice.
Especially the techniques are something you can put into action right away.

## A Bit of Everything

Some videos contain a lot of useful tips without a unifying topic to them.
Because they don’t really fit in any category, but it would be a shame to leave them out, they go here.

**rockentry – 6 Climbing Tips Taught by a Pro Climber**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-c4XCBNYY0)\
rockentry’s Oswaldo gets tips from Paul Robinson.
There are some good body positioning pointers for slab in there, as well as notes for general climbing process, and for what to do when difficult/long moves require more precision.
It’s probably a better video for when you gathered a bit of experience already, as it benefits a lot from being able to know the difficulties that these tips address.

**Bouldering Bobat – Climb Like Louis Parkinson With Three Simple Drills**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdC-INxsVs0)\
Louis is joining the Bobats to demonstrate three movement drills you can incorporate into your warmup climbing to improve your awareness of movement and body positioning.
One of them is the limb elimination drill also seen above in Andrew MacFarlane’s video with Louis on dynamic climbing.

**Emil Abrahamsson – These 4 Climbing Techniques Will Help You Improve**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykMApVq78JM)\
Emil is giving you a systematic run-down on engaging your hips, visualising before getting on the wall, using drop knees, and doing dynos that allows you to really think about where to integrate them into your climbing and why.
This might be one of those things that won’t immediately change your climbing, especially when you’re just starting out.
But instead, it will help you improve your approach and habits, and pay off over time.

**Bouldering Bobat – Climbing Tips for Shorter People ft. Xian**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la2Gil65fXk)\
Xian is joining Omar for some technique pointers how shorter climbers can improve their reach.
Definitely worth a watch, also for taller folks.

## Things & Gear

Bouldering, especially indoors, doesn’t require as much gear as any other climbing discipline.
But between the all-important climbing shoes and being prepared for the ups and downs of a day at the gym, there’s still plenty for us to obsess over.

**Jenn Sends – Climbing Bag Essentials for Starting Out**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1AzWUx_Js)\
Jenn’s run-down of what to take with you for a session at the gym.

**Jenn Sends – What’s in My Outdoor Bouldering Bag**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_8a29ifc9g)\
And the extended version for trips outdoors.

There are also a couple of channels worth watching for your regular climbing gear fix.
[EpicTV Climbing Daily](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRIbjrEHserQZ6O1Jd9wrg) have a gear episode each friday. (Keep in mind EpicTV is a gear shop)
And whenever a climbing-related trade show happens, most climbing websites will have staff on site, getting the sales pitches for upcoming gear and posting avalanches of videos to their respective YouTube channels.
[UKClimbing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4I1bqna9huMbtb5dG_8_Zw/) is just one example.
Also worth a look is [WeighMyRack](https://www.youtube.com/user/WeighMyRack), a smaller-staffed site, but exclusively gear-focused.

### Shoes

Ah, climbing shoes.
Is there any other gear item as obsessed over in excruciating detail as what we put on our feet?
I don’t think so.
Given that they are important, and that there are mistakes (like a misjudged fit – this one is especially relevant when you are a beginner) that can be very consequential for your climbing, they are definitely worth discussing.

**Eric Karlsson Bouldering – Shoes**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBxukNzgjDg)\
A good primer on what to look for in beginner shoes.

**Jenn Sends – The Tea on All My Climbing Shoes**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTqHD8LecXE)\
Another good Jenn Sends compilation of general knowledge.
She includes links to other videos and websites, and even compiled a playlist of good shoe-related videos she found.

**Adam Ondra – The Alchemy of Climbing Shoes**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5CT8B6eI0A)\
A big caveat up front:
**Do not mimick Adam Ondra’s shoe sizing!**
He downsizes his shoes to an incredible degree.
Not only would that be foot suicide for a beginner (or most advanced climbers), even La Sportiva, his sponsor, advised him to not downsize his shoes that much.
But his detailing of shoe characteristics and how they make different shoes good for different tasks is really useful knowledge to have in the back of your head.

## Knowledge & Mind Skills

Climbing as the engaging coupling of physical activity and puzzle solving, as an exciting confrontation of fear, or just as an activity where your unquiet mind can hamper your performance at least as much as a lack of technique or athleticism, there’s no arguing that mental skills and knowledge play a big part in climbing.

**Jenn Sends – Bouldering Lingo**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8PnyM7G5O8)\
**Bouldering Bobat – Climbing Terminology**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgKA5WrPqKA)\
Both of these videos go through climbing jargon you might encounter.
Besides enabling you to listen in on all the strong climbers, I think knowing words for things also gives you more concepts to throw at the world and therefore think about it with more specificity.
So don’t underestimate the use you can get out of knowing the lingo.

**Bouldering Bobat – Route Reading 101**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTInD0tGdn0)\
**Bouldering Bobat – How to Approach a Hard Climb**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNbNaybAfpU)\
Eventually, you’ll notice that you would benefit from a more organised, brainy approach to waste fewer attempts on hard climbs.
The Bobats made this pair of videos to tackle 1) how to decipher what to do with the holds on the wall, and 2) how to effectively work on solving hard projects.
It’s invaluable once you start really wanting to send a specific boulder and it keeps not happening.

**Anna Hazelnutt – How to Break Down (and Send) Your Climbing Project**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woqh_uxlriw)\
This is a good short companion to the Bouldering Bobat videos on projecting above.
Anna quickly shows her general stepwise process of tackling hard boulder problems, and then walks you through the solution she arrived at for a tricky slab boulder.
Very useful for the level of detail in her narration of the beta she worked out.

**Jenn Sends – Getting Over the Fear of Falling (bouldering)**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFvRr-IeDnA)\
This is a big topic that is likely to come up sooner or later in your bouldering career.
Jenn goes over the basics in an approachable and structured way, and compiled a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfbHmBfB2hVXnVZhfEHv1PJfvChOdQbVA) of falling-related videos for you to get insight from more than one point of view.

**Movement for Climbers – Instinct vs Control**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXXzaXgNHkg)\
MvC is quoting Bruce Lee on instinct and control as the elements of a dichotomy on how to approach an activity.
Once you have a little experience under your belt, I think this provides an interesting tool to analyse your climbing mind game for areas to improve.

## Good Youtube Channels to Follow

Sometimes, the best learning comes from just watching other people climb.
Watching gets you used to recognising patterns of movement, seeing solutions to problems, and all that will eventually rub off into what you’re going to think about when standing in front of your projects.

Also, it’s fun.

### My Big Three

**Eric Karlsson Bouldering**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/opuz1337)\
EKB is the OG indoor climbing channel.
Eric started in November 2015 making videos about indoor climbing when nobody believed anyone would want to watch people pull on plastic.
Most videos are indoor bouldering with a subset of a somewhat stable crew of friends in Stockholm’s Klättercentret.
The atmosphere in the videos is usually very friendly, with the occasional soft rivalry.
Catchphrase: Eric’s gasp from behind the camera when someone sticks an amazing move.

**Bouldering Bobat**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/omarbobat)\
Based in London, the Bobats are a group of friends around Omar Bobat who found each other in a climbing gym, and started making climbing vlogs.
Most videos are indoor bouldering plus copious applications of goofiness with the crew.
They also originated random challenges where the loser has to chug hot sauce.
Catchphrases: ‘WhaddupwhadduuupWHADDUUUUUUUP?’, ‘Fuckin’ ’ell’, ‘Geezer’

**Magnus Midtbø**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/magmidt88)\
Magnus is a former professional climber from Norway who now found his way onto Youtube.
If he wasn’t such a humble, likeable guy, it would be incredibly annoying how strong he is.
Most videos revolve around climbing or Magnus being absurdly strong on camera, but he also undertakes interesting stuff now that he doesn’t have to focus on climbing 24/7 anymore, and frequently collaborates with other youtubers like Jujimufu/Tom & Juji, or even a stealthy surprise three-way collab with EKB and the Bobats.
Catchphrase: The sound of Magnus chalking up.

### Channels Run by Women

**Anna Davey**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN6M0uYYyYMdZUHrYY3b3Yw)\
Anna of the impossibly shredded abs, former disciple of iron, first of her name, is a world cup competition climber from Australia and makes climbing videos with her husband, Tom Kaskow.
Come for the sends, stay for their banter.

**Anna Hazelnutt**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyGqObd717uKwGWf_KdNbXw)\
Anna describes her channel as climbing, van life, travel, and shenanigans.
It is an apt description, and totally worth checking out for its charm and heart.

**Bouldering Dabrats**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLze_9DjASz_ZxB7UTt2Alw)\
Annie and Di from London are friends of the Bobats, just as goofy, and an absolute joy to watch!
Also interesting for climbers at either end of the body height spectrum, as Annie and Di frequently have to find tall-girl and short-girl beta for their climbs.

**Hannah Morris**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/hcemorris)\
Hannah from the UK is making videos that are heavier on outdoor bouldering than the others, and with very a pleasant, storytelling-heavy style.

**Jenn Sends**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaQ7laUNRnsAwk6KbPwtJIg)\
Jenn from LA, California is really good at giving off chill welcoming vibes.
Big recommendation for everyone, especially people just starting out and people with an interest in maybe tackling outdoor bouldering one day.
She has a knack for making tips videos that sound like advice given by your bouldering big sister, not stone tablets handed down from the mountains of climbing godhood.

**Sofya Yokoyama**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4_7FcmF_Kahg05ppmzL7g)\
Sofya climbs on the Swiss national team and was also featured in a collaboration with Eric Karlsson Bouldering a while ago.
On her own channel, she aims to update once per week with videos about climbing and training.
She is also absurdly strong.

### Everything Else Worth Checking Out

**Adam Ondra**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8eNyF9eYwgr_K-Nl4gSHWw)\
Probably the world’s best climber right now.
In the march up to the Tokyo 2020 olympics, he launched a weekly video series called ‘Road to Tokyo’.

**Albert Ok**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUqIRJJJeKgbuNAPTl_Afig)\
Albert is a competition climber and former coach who makes videos focused on technique and training to improve your technique.
Especially his ‘Beta Break’ series is very informative for climbers of all levels – even if you have no chance (yet!) of pulling off the moves shown, the level of detailed technique analysis can’t not benefit you.

**Andrew MacFarlane**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewGMacFarlane)\
A canadian living in London.
He regularly makes videos with the legendary Louis Parkinson, the man who can campus everything.
Like Magnus, Louis seems like the nicest and most helpful kind of chap, so you can’t even be angry at him being so strong.
And when Andrew starts flexing his video production chops, you’re going to be in for a treat.

**Dave MacLeod**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/davemacleod1)\
A scottish pro climber for 25 years who can do it all, from bouldering to ice climbing to nerding out about nutrition and science.
His channel is similarly broad and just overwhelming in its generosity.

**Emil Abrahamsson**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqiKFGkSZwrbMSfkkd2CQGg)\
Emil is a member of the EKB crew and posts mostly outdoor bouldering on his own channel.

**EpicTV Climbing Daily**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRIbjrEHserQZ6O1Jd9wrg)\
A climbing focussed programme run by EpicTV, a climbing and outdoor online shop.
Climbing news, events, sick sends, and gear news.

**Hooper’s Beta**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/c/HoopersBeta)\
Dr. Jason Hooper and Emile Modesitt have helpful information for climbers on things like injuries, exercise, physical health, and technique.
It pays off keeping an eye on these before you get injured. ;)

**The IFSC**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/ifscchannel)\
The International Federation of Sport Climbing.
Now that climbing is getting bigger as an international competition sport, this is your place if you want to watch the world’s comp elite battle it out in bouldering, sport, and speed climbing.

**mellow**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/c/mellowclimbing)\
An outdoor focussed channel started by bouldering powerhouses Shawn Raboutou, Giuliano Cameroni, Jimmy Webb, Keenan Takahashi, Kevin Takashi Smith, and Daniel Woods.
These folks are the real deal.

**Tomoa / Akiyo / Ikedai**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3XxWczzWgm1bLmgdeQJMw)\
A channel run by japanese top climbers Tomoa Narasaki, Akiyo Noguchi, and Yudai ‘Ikedai’ Ikeda.
They have a good mix of tutorial-style and personal/fun videos, all with english subtitles.

**Wide Boyz**: [link](https://www.youtube.com/c/WideBoyz)\
Tom Randall and Pete Whittaker are among the world’s strongest climbers of rock cracks – any angle and any width, from fitting a single finger to half a body, chances are these two can climb up it.
They are singularly focused on a style of climbing you are unlikely to see too much of in gyms.
