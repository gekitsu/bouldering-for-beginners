# Bouldering for Beginners (bfb)

This repository contains a selection of links to video tutorials aimed at beginner boulderers.
It is not meant to be an exhaustive listing of all tutorials or channels, but rather a somewhat curated list to help a beginner on their way.

## Acknowledgements

`<3` to everyone who makes videos about bouldering or climbing, writes articles, or helps new people in the gym or at the crag.
You are the best.

## Contributions

Yes please! While I watch a lot of bouldering videos, I can’t possibly watch all of it. Also, I am most definitely not the last word on what makes a useful tutorial video, so all contributions are welcome!

If you have an account on here, feel free to pull request. Otherwise, I hang out a lot on the Discord of the [Bouldering Bobat YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/omarbobat/) (same username as here) – that’s probably the easiest way to hit me up for climbing-related chitchat.
